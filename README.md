# boilerplates

> :warning: If a branch has not had any commits for a long time, be aware of depreciations.

Life is too short to start new projects from scratch. Thus, this repo servers as collection of boilerplates for technologies I work with the most.

Each boilerplate will live in its own branch. The branches will be maintained as long as I fancy the stack. use them at your own risk.

#### Start By Installing [Degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit)

```
npm install -g degit
```

#### Use the following command to initiate your project based on a branch:
```
degit jihedmastouri/boilerplates#<branch name> <your project name>
```
> Leave the `Project name` blank to initiate in the current directory.

### Branches:

- `react`: Building SPA never been this amazing.
